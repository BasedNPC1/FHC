Hey, 
this is the hub to where you can look around and see what's up with our tech

# Sweep

Sweeps the shaft of an RC [servo motor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servo_motor#RC_servos) back and forth across 180 degrees.

## Hardware Required

* Arduino Board
* Servo Motor
* Hook-up wires

## Circuit

Servo motors have three wires: power, ground, and signal. The power wire is typically red, and should be connected to the 5V pin on the Arduino board. The ground wire is typically black or brown and should be connected to a ground pin on the board. The signal pin is typically yellow, orange or white and should be connected to pin 9 on the board.
