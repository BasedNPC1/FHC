Yo gang, 

this right here is the spot to vibe and check out what's cookin' with our tech stack ðŸ’¥

it been real, it's been fun

## IT'S BEEN REAL FUN ðŸš€

## If this coin pumps hard, we're takin' profits to build our first Solana Rocket engine â€“ unlike any thruster out there, straight fire ðŸ”¥

# SWEEP

Sweeps that RC [servo motor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servo_motor#RC_servos) shaft back and forth across 180 degrees. Easy mode activated.

## Hardware Required

* Arduino Board ðŸ¤–

* Servo Motor

* Hook-up wires

## Circuit

Servo motors got three wires: power, ground, and signal. Power wire usually red â€“ hook it to the 5V pin on your Arduino board. Ground wire black or brown, slam it into a ground pin. Signal pin yellow, orange, or white â€“ connect to pin 9, no cap.
